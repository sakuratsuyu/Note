# Chapter 3 | The Fundamentals: Algorithms

## Algorithms

!!! definition
    An **algorithm** is a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or solving problem.

    **Pseudocode** is instructions given in a generic language similar to a computer language.

!!! theorem "Properties"
    - Input and Output
    - Definiteness
    - Correctness
    - Finiteness
    - Effectiveness
    - Generality

## Complexity

!!! definition
    **Complexity** is the amount of time or space needed to execute the algorithm.

    - Space Complexity
    - Time Complexity
        - Types: best-case time; worst-case time; average-case time.

- **P-Class**	problems can be solved by polynomial time algorithm
- **NP-Class**	problems for which a solution can be checked in polynomial time
- **NP-Complete Problem**
    - If any of these problems can be solved by polynomial worst-case time algorithm, then all can be solved by polynomial worst-case time algorithms.
