    ## Abstraction
    
    working in a high level of abstraction is a good thing. If something goes wrong, you can fix it.

    ## Hardware vs. Software

## Computer System
- CPU
- MEM	storage / memory
- I / O	INPUT / OUTUT
   - Input
      - Keyboard'
   - Output
      - Monitor

### LC -3 / Little Computer No.3

LC - 1 and LC - 2 are not good enough.


## The Level of Transformation

| Software | Problems in Natual Language |
| --- | --- |
|  | Algorithm  |
|  | Program |
| Interface | Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) |
| Hardware | Microarchitecture |
|  | Logic circuits |
|  | Electronic circuits |
|  | Electrons |

    **Algorithm**
    
    step by step procedures
    
    Thress properties

    - definiteness: No ambiguity
    - effectively computable
    - finite

    **Program**

    - Programming language
    - Program to ISA : Compiler
    - Assembly language
    - Assembly to ISA : Assembler

    **ISA**

    - where microprocessor has
    - compatibility
    - Intel / AMD	x86
    - 8086
    - 286
    - 386
    - 486
    - Pentium
    - Pentium Pro
    - Pentium M
    - IBM			Power-PC
    - SPARC
    - Z-series

    **Microarchitecture**

    - Tradeoffs
